# Postal 2 Redux Kickstarter OBS Overlay


This overlay was made specifically for the Postal 2 Redux Kickstarter campaign. It is AI-generated but has been human tested for reliability and usability.

It provides a transparent, modern HTML overlay for OBS that displays the current pledged amount from the campaign and visualizes user-configurable stretch goals.

## Features
- Fetches live pledged amount from a Kickstarter JSON endpoint (see note below)
- User-configurable stretch goals via a simple JSON config file
- Passed goals and their markers turn red with a strikethrough
- Responsive, compact, and visually clear overlay
- Transparent background for seamless OBS integration

## How the Kickstarter Data is Fetched
**Note:** The Kickstarter API endpoint used (`/stats.json`) is not officially documented. It was discovered by inspecting the network requests in the browser's developer tools while viewing the Postal 2 Redux Kickstarter campaign page. This endpoint may change or become unavailable at any time, and is not guaranteed to be stable or supported by Kickstarter.

## Setup & Usage
1. **Edit your stretch goals:**
   - Open `config/stretchgoals.json` and add your custom goals. Example:
     ```json
     [
       { "amount": 250000, "label": "Kickstarter Funded" },
       { "amount": 275000, "label": "Time of Day Effect" },
       { "amount": 300000, "label": "Sandbox Mode" },
       { "amount": 400000, "label": "Console Modding" }
     ]
     ```
2. **Start the local server:**
   - In the project folder, run:
     ```sh
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
   - This will serve the overlay at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. **Add to OBS:**
   - In OBS, add a new Browser Source.
   - Set the URL to `http://localhost:3000` and adjust the width/height as needed.

## Customization
- Edit `public/overlay.css` for colors, fonts, and sizing.
- Edit `public/overlay.js` for advanced logic or layout changes.

## Troubleshooting
- If the overlay does not update, make sure the server is running and the Kickstarter endpoint is still available.
- If you see CORS or fetch errors, always use the provided Node.js server (do not open the HTML file directly in your browser).
